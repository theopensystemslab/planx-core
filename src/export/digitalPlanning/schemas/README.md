This subfolder contains files for managing the Digital Planning JSON schema and type generation process for the project.

## Files

1. **schema.json**: This file holds the JSON schema, copied from the `digital-planning-data-schemas`` repository. If there's a new version of the schema, update this file by copying and pasting the new schema content here.

2. **types.d.ts**: This file is automatically generated by the `json-schema-to-typescript` library and contains TypeScript type declarations based on the JSON schema. **Do not modify this file directly**, as it will be overwritten by the type generation process.

## Workflow

1. **Updating Schema**:
   - When a new version of the schema is available, copy the new schema from the `digital-planning-data-schemas` repository.
   - Replace the content of the `schema.json` file in this subfolder with the updated schema.

2. **Generating Types**:
   - Run the command `pnpm generate-types-from-schema` in the project's root directory.
   - This command will automatically update the `types.d.ts` file based on the contents of the `schema.json` file.

That's all you need to do to manage the JSON schema and type generation in this subfolder. Keep the `schema.json` file up-to-date and use the provided command to generate types as needed.
