/**
 * A Position is an array of coordinates. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.1 Array should contain between two and three elements. The previous GeoJSON specification allowed more elements (e.g., which could be used to represent M values), but the current specification only allows X, Y, and (optionally) Z to be defined.
 *
 * Note: the type will not be narrowed down to `[number, number] | [number, number, number]` due to marginal benefits and the large impact of breaking change.
 *
 * See previous discussions on the type narrowing:
 * -  {@link  https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/21590 Nov 2017 }
 * -  {@link  https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/discussions/67773 Dec 2023 }
 * -  {@link  https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/discussions/71441 Dec 2024 }
 *
 * One can use a  {@link  https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates user-defined type guard that returns a type predicate }  to determine if a position is a 2D or 3D position.
