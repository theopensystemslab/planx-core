      notes:
        "Generally 'granny annexes' do not need planning permission, allowing an annexe connected to a house to be kitted out with facilities necessary for independent living (such as bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms), as long as the annexe remains under the aegis of the main house.\nFrom a legal standpoint, the ability to undertake this conversion hinges on whether a material change of use would occur under Section 55 (1) rather than whether the proposal met any permitted development rights under the provisions of the GPDO.\nProviding an additional bedroom, a living area, kitchen and bathroom cannot be construed as \"incidental\" as per S55 (2d) as it resulted in primary accommodation, but it does not necessarily follow that a material change of use would occur in these circumstances. The real question is whether a separate dwellinghouse and a new planning unit would be formed. The judgment in Uttlesford DC v SOS and White, 1991 holds that there was no reason in law why a granny annexe with all the facilities for day-to-day living would automatically become a separate planning unit.\nThere are circumstances where the proposal for conversion is motivated by an older generation wishing to downsize, rather than to meet any current healthcare needs. The old generation may be more than likely to live independently of those in the 'main house', which would go against the general view of what a granny annexe normally constituted. However, if a 'separate planning unit' would not be formed, there is a sufficently intimate physical relationship between the dwelling and the annex, a lack of any physical subdivision of the garden, driveway or parking areas, no separate address would be created such that utilities would be billed as a single property, in some judges view this meets the base criteria of being a granny annexe. Use as a granny annexe does not certify that the use of the property would be lawful if used in a different manner from that put forward or if circumstances were to change in future.",
